# Acknowledgements

<h2 style="font-style: italic; font-family: serif;">Thank You! 🙏</h2>

Many thanks to our incredible guest performers for donating their talents to help us raise funds for summer music school: 

* Lance Welch
* Mona Chang
* Cathy Herrera
* Susan Kroeker
* Grace Yang
* Kurt Kroeker
* Steve Baird

We couldn't do this without your help!

<b>Elsa, Charlotte, and Alanna</b> would like to thank their private music educators for their ongoing investment. We are deeply grateful for not only their skill but also their generosity to us. Susan Kroeker is Elsa’s flute instructor. Olivia Leskowicz is Elsa's vocal instructor. Charlotte has studied percussion with Dr. James Latten. All three of us (along with another sister!) study piano with Kristin Stephenson. We wouldn’t make nearly as much progress without you!

All three of us would also like to thank the ensemble and school educators who have poured so much into us:

* Roy Schaeffer (Park Forest Elementary School, retired)
* Dr. Patrick Feher (Park Forest Elementary School)
* Ronica Brownson (Park Forest Middle School)
* Paul Leskowicz (State College Area High School)
* Erik Clayton (State College Area High School)
* Douglas Schunk (State College Area High School)
* Emma Van Allen (State College Area High School)
* Sarah Shafer (Nittany Valley Children’s Choir)
* Wendy Bachman (former piano teacher)

<b>Josephine</b> would like to share her own deeply-felt gratitude for the following influences on her musical and personal development:

* Lou Ann Shafer (Josephine's first and late piano instructor, late director of Nittany Valley Children's Choir)
* Wendy Bachman (Josephine's second piano instructor)
* Sarah Shafer (Director of Nittany Valley Children's Choir)
* Kristin Stephenson (Josephine's current piano instructor)

Thanks to Oakwood Presbyterian Church for allowing us to use their facility. We’re grateful for Caleb Olshefsky, who designed our flier, and for Dan Miller, who designed the program. And many thanks to YOU for coming to hear the recital!
