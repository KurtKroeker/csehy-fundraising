bio: >
  Elsa Krol (flute, piano) is in 11th grade homeschool. She is involved in a
  number of ensembles at State College Area High School, including Symphonic
  Band, Marching Band, Symphony Orchestra, Master Singers, and Flute Choir. She
  was selected to perform on piano in the 2024 PMEA District 4 Jazz Band and
  on flute in the 2025 PMEA District Orchestra, District Band, Region Band, and
  All-State Wind Ensemble. What she most enjoys about attending Csehy Summer
  School of Music is all the practice time, the Christian instruction, the
  music theory classes, and the dramatic improvement to her personal
  musicianship. When she’s not playing music, she enjoys reading, writing,
  goofing off with her siblings, babysitting, and playing board games.
