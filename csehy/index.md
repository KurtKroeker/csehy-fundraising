Csehy (pronounced “CHAY-hee”) Summer School of Music exists to honor, praise and serve our Lord Jesus Christ by providing a Christian context and a spiritual emphasis for the study of superior classical and sacred music for junior and senior high school students. Through musical ensembles and private lessons, campers engage daily with highly-qualified faculty from colleges and orchestras across the country. Faculty challenge campers to higher levels of performance while nurturing their Christian faith.

All students participate in the Concert Choir and at least one more major ensemble (Symphony Orchestra, Concert Band, String Orchestra, Handbells, or Chamber Choir). All campers receive two half-hour private lessons per week for their major instrument. They are expected to practice two hours per day in preparation for these lessons. Daily music theory classes are also held based on the student’s placement, from beginning note reading to advanced analysis and history seminars.

Elsa first attended one week of Csehy’s high school program in 2023, and her flute teacher noted how remarkable her progress was in just that short time. This year, she hopes to attend all three weeks of high school camp, along with a selective fourth week that emphasizes chamber music performance. Charlotte plans to attend two weeks of the high school program. Alanna will attend Csehy for the first time, participating in the one-week middle school program. The total cost for these seven weeks is about $4,250.

Josephine plans to attend Csehy for the first time, participating in the one-week middle school program. The cost is $950.
